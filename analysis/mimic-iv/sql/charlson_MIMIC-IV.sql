/*The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a scoring system that quantifies a 
patient's comorbidity burden by assigning numeric values to various chronic conditions. 
The total score is calculated by summing these values, and it is used to predict 
and morbidity in patients with chronic illnesses. The CCI is widely employed in medical 
research to stratify patients based on comorbidity and adjust outcomes for differences
in baseline health*/
